Talk to your screen and watch it paint

## What is this?
I love playing with canvas apps and wanted to create an app where you can talk to the screen and based on the **_sentiment_** of what you are saying it would start painting.

So as you talk, based on whether the sentiment of the sentence is HAPPY/NEUTRAL/SAD it will paint in different styles and different colours.

## Cool, how do I use it?
This app uses cognitive services from Microsoft Azure, specifically the Speech API and the Text API. I have included my subscription keys that allow 5000 calls per month. You can get your own keys for **FREE** by following these links to the
[Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/) and the 
[Text API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/).

Have fun :)
